# Thyroid-Detection-Project
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages therefore it is crucial to detect it as soon as possible.

This project aims at creating an application which helps us predict whether an individual has hypothyroid or not given his/her attributes like age, sex and some levels of the thyroid hormones etc.
